# ComputerShutdownTimer
An application for setting a time when your computer should shutdown.

This application is designed to force your computer to shutdown at a specified time.

Time values entered must have 2 digits. For example, if you want to shutdown your computer at 5 PM, enter 05 into the hours field
and 00 into the minutes field.

This application cannot be closed unless you kill the task.

A downloadable executable file is not available yet. Currently, this program can be built in an IDE and an executable .jar file
should be made in the dist folder.

This project was inspired by my poor sleep schedule and a desire to kick myself off the computer at a reasonable time.

Enjoy!
